# Backend Dev Skill

This guide provides extra information for Makers who are completing the Backend Dev Skill. 

## Backend 

Backend Developers write scripts for servers. Unlike Frontend Developers, the code Backend Developers write, while it gives a lot of functionality to a site (like login ins and pulling up lists of your favorite projects on DIY) it isn't as visible as the elements built into the HTML. 

Most of the time Backend Devs write their code for the servers that host websites. These scripts tell the server what to give the browser when it comes asking for things. You can imagine this conversation between a browser (often refered to as the "client") and a server. 

*when someone types www.diy.org into their browser and hit's go!*

> BROWSER: Hey Server! You've got the things I need for this website, www.diy.org.

> SERVER: Oh, hey Browser! Yeah, I've got that stuff and some instructions on how to hand it off to you. What's your request?

> BROWSER: Great! I'm requesting: 1 this, 2 that, 3 that


> SERVER: Yep, I've got a response for each of those things: 1 this, 2 that, 3 that

This type of conversation runs the gammit of handing off the HTML for a site to storing information in databases and giving it back when it's requested (like when you log in to DIY and it pulls up your account, your favorites, your followers...).

## Node.js

There are a few backend (also called "server-side") coding languages: PHP, Python, Ruby and Node. Backend Developers usually specialize in one. We're going to build the challenges around Node.js. We're quite partial to Node.js here at DIY - our site is built on it. It's also just javascript, which you learn in the Frontend Developer Skill and which makes for a unique situation: know one langauge and you can program in two environments, the browser and the server.
