# Server-side Dev Supplemental Resource Pages

Pages that we created to aid in the [Backend Dev Skill](https://diy.org/skills/backenddev).

## Simply Speaking

The raw markdown files for each challenge can be found in the [contents folder](https://github.com/diy/server-side-dev.diy.org/tree/master/content).

## Technically Speaking

This is a node.js app that serves up static files from a cache of markdown files compiled into HTML. Woo!

### To Run

    node app.js
