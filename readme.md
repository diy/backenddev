# Front-end Dev Supplemental Resource Pages

Pages that we created to aid in the [Front-end Dev Skill](https://diy.org/skills/front-enddev).

## Simply Speaking

The raw markdown files for each challenge can be found in the [contents folder](https://github.com/diy/opensourcerer.diy.org/tree/master/content).

### To Run

    node app.js
