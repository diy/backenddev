# Deploy an App

When you're scripting a lot of action with the server, storing data, using logins... your website is at this point often refered to as a web app. It's become more than a static site, it's an application with many features. The DIY website would be considered a web app.

Just like you can host a static website on a server, you can host your web app. You'll need to use a server that has your backend scripting language installed on it. A hosting service for Node.js is Nodejitsu. Heroku is another.
