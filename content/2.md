# Run a Node.js Server

[NPM](http://www.npmjs.org), Node Packaged Modules, is the library of things people have built with Node.js to handle common tasks. They're all open source and availble for anyone to use!

We've created a module to use in this challenge to show how servers work. 

When you create an HTML file locally, like we do in the [Frontend Dev Skill](http://www.diy.org/skills/frontenddev), you can open it up in your browser and the browser will render all the elements it's able to and it will look like a webpage. It's reading the HTML, CSS and JS from a file it has access to.

But as you know, most of the websites you want to visit aren't already on your computer, they're on the internet. Your browser has to render the elements it gets from servers. It asks for things like images and lines of code and the server gives it to them. This back and forth of requests and responses is what browsers and servers do all day.

With Node.js we can mimic that back and forth request/response relationship locally, on our computer. We can do that by writing a simple server. In the example we've made a simple server serves up an HTML page. 

Instead of seeing the local location of an HTML file you'll see the name of your local server.
