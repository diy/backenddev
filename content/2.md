# Run a Node.js Server

[NPM](http://www.npmjs.org), Node Packaged Modules, is the library of things people have built with Node.js to handle common tasks. They're all open source and availble for anyone to use! We've created a module to use in this challenge to show how servers work. 

## Local Files versus Local Server

When you create an HTML file locally, like in the [Frontend Dev Skill](http://www.diy.org/skills/frontenddev), and open it up in your browser, the browser will render all the elements it's able to and it will look like a webpage. It's reading the HTML, CSS and JS from a file it has access to.

But as you know, most of the websites you want to visit aren't already on your computer, they're on the internet. Your browser has get the elements from servers that it needs to make the page. This back and forth of **requests** and **responses** is what goes on in between browsers and servers.

When you program servers, you're telling them what to do about the different kinds of requests they get. 

With Node.js we can mimic that back and forth **request/response** relationship locally, using our omputer as a server. To do that, we'll write an HTTP server.

*HTTP is HyperText Transfer Protocol and it's a way of moving HTML or HyperText Markup Language, files around with servers.*

## Our Simple Web Server Example

We've made a simple server that serves up an HTML page. It's on NPM and easy to instal. In your Bash, create a folder for this project, go inside that folder and install the module:

    mkdir super-simple-server
    cd super-simple-server
    npm install super-simple-server

### Run the Server

To run this Node.js module, we'll tell node to run `app.js`, which is the file in the module with the server code. 

    node app.js

It should tell you that it's lisening on local port 3000. Now open a browser and visit `localhost:3000` and you'll see the website! 

### What this Server is Doing

![request-response](http://diy-visualpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/request-response.png)

The diagram above illustrates how this whole thing works: 

* We create a server with instructions on how to handle a request
* When the server gets a request it goes and fetches the file and it's information
* It pipes out that information back as a response to the browser
* The browser uses that information to build the website

#### To complete the challenge take a screenshot of your terminal running the Node.js.
