# Run a Node.js Server

[NPM](http://www.npmjs.org), Node Packaged Modules, is the library of things people have built with Node.js to handle common tasks. They're all open source and availble for anyone to use! We've created a module to use in this challenge to show how servers work. 

## Local Files versus Local Server

When you create an HTML file locally, like in the [Frontend Dev Skill](http://www.diy.org/skills/frontenddev), and open it up in your browser, the browser will render all the elements it's able to and it will look like a webpage. It's reading the HTML, CSS and JS from a file it has access to.

But as you know, most of the websites you want to visit aren't already on your computer, they're on the internet. Your browser has get the elements from servers that it needs to make the page. It asks for things like images and lines of code and the server hands them over. This back and forth of **requests** and **responses** is what browsers and servers do all day.

With Node.js we can mimic that back and forth request/response relationship locally, on our computer. We can do that by writing a simple HTTP server.

*HTTP is HyperText Transfer Protocol and it's a way of moving HTML or HyperText Markup Language, files around with servers.*

## Our Simple Web Server Example

We've made a simple server that serves up an HTML page. It's on NPM and easy to instal. In your Bash, type:

    npm install super-simple-server
