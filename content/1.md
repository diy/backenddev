# Backend and Node.js

Backend Developers write scripts for servers. Unlike Frontend Developers, the code Backend Developers write, while it gives a lot of functionality to a site (like login ins and pulling up lists of your favorite projects on DIY) it isn't as visible as the elements built into the HTML. 

Most of the time Backend Devs write their code for the servers that host websites. These scripts tell the tell the server what to give the browser when it comes asking for things. You can imagine a conversation between a browser (often refered to as the "client") and a server. 

*when someone types www.diy.org into their browser and hit's go!*

BROWSER: Hey Server! You've got the things I want for this website, www.diy.org.

SERVER: Oh, hey Browser! Yeah, I've got that stuff and some instructions on how to hand it off to you. What's your request?

BROWSER: Great! I'm requesting:

- this
- that
- this
- that

SERVER: Yep, I've got a response for each of those things:

- blah
- blab
- yada
- blah
